1. How to configure ?

In order to use a product (Certissim, Kwixo, Sceau) you have to report your private data (given by Fia-Net team) into the configuration file of the concerned service.
This file is in the folder lib/servicename/const/site_params.yml.
Once you've written your login, password, siteid, etc. in the file you can start implementating your scripts.

Be careful to include only the files you need. Check the file lib/includes/includes.inc.php and comment the lines you don't need.
For example if you're implementing Certissim but you've not subscribed Kwixo and Sceau please set the include file as following :
<?php
define('FIANET_USE_CDATA', true); //set it to true if you want to protect the values in the XML stream from special chars that could break the stream and cause errors. We strongly advise you to let it set to true.
define('ROOT_DIR', str_replace('\\', '/', realpath(dirname(__FILE__).'/../..')));

//these lines are mandatory
require_once ROOT_DIR . '/lib/includes/functions.inc.php';
require_once ROOT_DIR . '/lib/kernel/includes.inc.php';
require_once ROOT_DIR . '/lib/common/includes.inc.php';

//these lines are not mandatory. Uncomment only the ones you need
//require_once ROOT_DIR . '/lib/kwixo/includes.inc.php'; //kwixo is commented because I don't want to use it
require_once ROOT_DIR . '/lib/sac/includes.inc.php'; //sac is not commented because I'm implementing it on my e-shop
//require_once ROOT_DIR . '/lib/sceau/includes.inc.php'; //Sceau is commented because I don't want to use it
